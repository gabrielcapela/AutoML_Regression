# Regression with AutoML
</p>

## **Health Insurance Cost Prediction**

Welcome to my project on predicting health insurance costs using AutoML! This project demonstrates how powerful and efficient PyCaret and Pandas Profiling are for solving complex problems with minimal code. The goal is to predict health insurance costs based on features like age, smoking status, and BMI, helping companies make data-driven decisions and offer tailored products to customers.

### ðŸ”§ Whatâ€™s Inside
**Pandas Profiling** & **PyCaret**: First, I used Pandas Profiling to generate a comprehensive report on the dataset, providing insights into missing values, correlations, and data distributions. Then, I used PyCaret to automate the entire machine learning process, including preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, scaling features, and detecting outliers), model comparison (compare_models()), model tuning (tune_model()), and training the final model for predictions. The model was saved for future use.

### âš¡ Main Goal
This projectâ€™s main objective is to showcase the PyCaret and Pandas Profiling tools, which allow both data scientists and beginners to streamline their machine learning workflows with just a few lines of code. The focus is on automating processes and accelerating model development, all while producing meaningful insights.
